## Usage:
It is as simple as writing `richweather <city-name>`
Please note that the city name is not case sensitive and there are many ways you can enter it.
For example: New York can be written as: `New_York new_york NEw_yOrK "New york" NYC`

## Capabilities:
`richweather` displays the following info (in order):

**Left bar:**
- Current temp
- Day's max temp
- Day's min temp
- Wind speed

**Right Column**
- Weather
- Humidity *(in %age)*
- Precepitation *(in mm)*
- Moon phase

`richweather` uses [**nerdfonts**](https://www.nerdfonts.com/) to display the symbols. What I use is JetBrains Mono Nerd Font so I know it works. You can try different nerd fonts to see if your works.
